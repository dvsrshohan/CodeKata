### Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code

    Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

  - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
  - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
  - Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
  - Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
    Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
